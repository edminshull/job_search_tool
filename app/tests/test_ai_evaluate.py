"""Sanity test for ai_evaluate.py's non-API-calling parts: profile loading,
prompt construction, and the DB round-trip (save_evaluation -> CSV output).
Doesn't call Anthropic — that needs a real API key and costs money, so it's
excluded from this offline test. Run with: python -m app.tests.test_ai_evaluate

Loads profile.example.yaml rather than profile.yaml (which is gitignored
and holds your real, personal experience) so this test works the same for
everyone regardless of what's in their own profile.
